In this course we've taken our years of photography experience and squeezed  as much knowledge as possible into a beginner-friendly course.

We'll teach you actionable tips and tricks that you can try today, even in your own home with whatever camera you already have (including your phone!)

Over 7 days we'll share video tutorials, real life examples and practical activities, as well as a private facebook community.

## Course Outline
Day 1 - How to find the best lighting (even if you are stuck inside)
Day 2 - Setting up a scene for food & product photography
Day 3 - How to have a mini-photoshoot in your living room or backyard
Day 4 - Lightroom editing basics with Emilio
Day 5 - Marie & Jake show you how to take photos with a tripod & timer
Day 6 - Step-by-step walkthrough of editing a photo for instagram with Jake
Day 7 - Manual Photography Basics (Understanding Aperture, Shutter Speed & ISO)


## Excited yet?  

Each day weâ€™ll share a new video and a dedicated post in the FB community for you to ask questions, share your insights and show us what you capture each day of the challenge.

Don't forget that at the end of the challenge we're going to hand-pick 3 people to receive one-on-one feedback on their photography. We're not looking for the 'best' photos, but for whoever shows the most enthusiasm and commitment to the challenge and to inspiring others to give it a try.

*To boost your chances of being selected to win the one-on-one feedback:*

- comment on the daily post in the facebook community sharing your own shot
- be a supportive part of the community by cheering on the efforts of your peers as they share their photos each day.
- share your progress or behind-the-scenes on your instagram tagging your mentors @eyesofanomad @mariefeandjakesnow and @instituteofcode
