**Excited yet? &nbsp;**

Each day weâ€™ll share a new video and a&nbsp;[dedicated post in the FB community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/243183530226683/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;for you to ask questions, share your insights and show us what you capture each day of the challenge.&nbsp;

Don't forget that at the end of the challenge we're going to hand-pick 3 people to receive one-on-one feedback on their photography. We're not looking for the 'best' photos, but for whoever shows the most enthusiasm and commitment to the challenge and to inspiring others to give it a try.&nbsp;
