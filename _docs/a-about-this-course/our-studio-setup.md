We've had so many questions about the studio setup that we used to film this challenge and would love to shine a light on the amazing small-businesses that we bought from.&nbsp;

Most of the furniture you can see in our tutorials comes from [Au Fait Living](https://www.instagram.com/aufaitliving/?hl=en){: target="_blank"}.

These are some of our favourites ( *puppies not included\!&nbsp;*)
