Oh hey there, welcome to day 1. Today we’re going to look at lighting, one of the most essential components of photography -- join us as we head out to shoot at a beautiful rice terrace here in Bali, and then back in our villa with techniques you can use at home. &nbsp;

Watch the video, then complete the activity and share your results in the facebook community\!&nbsp;

&lt;DAY 1 VIDEO&gt;&nbsp;

## Day 1 Activity&nbsp;

Today's activity is all about experimenting with lighting

* Track the light in your space, watching where the light moves throughout the day and identifying good spots for soft natural lighting.&nbsp;
* Try capturing a photo at golden hour and again an hour later, and see the difference for yourself&nbsp;
* Film yourself spinning in a circle and watch how the light on your face changes, or move your hand around and see the light and shadows. Don’t be afraid to experiment.

Then when you are ready, try to take one shot -- of yourself, your family member or friend, your pets, or even products you find around the house. Share this shot, along with your biggest 'aha' moment in the&nbsp;[facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/243183530226683/){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;

## Win a one-on-one feedback from your mentors

At the end of this challenge we’re going to be hand selecting 3 people to receive one-on-one feedback from your mentors on the photos you've taken during the challenge\! &nbsp;
