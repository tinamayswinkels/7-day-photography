In the last lesson we looked at how to shoot portraits at home, but what about when you are shooting by yourself? Or when you want to take a photo as a couple or family and don't have anyone to take the shot?&nbsp;

In this lesson, Marie & Jake walk us through their creative process for shooting content themselves and get pretty creative with a hummus jar\!&nbsp;

Today's activity? Shoot a self-portrait (solo, with a friend or partner, or even with your pet\!). Practice framing the shot and then using a self-timer to capture it.&nbsp;

If you can, share a photo behind-the-scenes too or tell us about how you you set up the shot?&nbsp;
