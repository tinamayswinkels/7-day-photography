Today's activity is to practice editing a photo that you've taken so far just on your phone (this will be easiest if you already have good lighting\!).&nbsp;<br><br>If you want to test out using the preset that Jake used in the demo, we're giving it away for [FREE here](https://thisismaja.com/#free-preset){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;on the new MAJA website ( that we coded from scratch ðŸ˜‰).&nbsp;

Need help installing the preset? There is a [helpful tutorial here](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_eX3pKDkbQ/?igshid=cu0y6bjzk0na){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;
