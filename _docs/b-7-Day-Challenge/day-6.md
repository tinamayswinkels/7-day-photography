In today's lesson Jake will walk you through basic editing on an iPhone using lightroom mobile. Watch till the end where you'll show you how to easily remove objects from your photos\!&nbsp;

&lt;video&gt;&nbsp;

Today's activity is to practice editing a photo that you've taken so far just on your phone (this will be easiest if you already have good lighting\!).&nbsp;<br><br>If you want to test out using the preset that Jake used in the demo, we're giving it away for FREE here.&nbsp;
