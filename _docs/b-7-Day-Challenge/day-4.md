We'll look at how to nail your exposure using the exposure slider contrast, whites, blacks, highlights & shadows. Then we'll look at getting the white balance correct by adjusting the color temperature and tone. Finally we'll show you how you can get creative and take your photos to the next level using selective color editing and split toning.&nbsp;

We'll be teaching you this lesson on Adobe Lightroom which is part of the $10 per month Photography Package in Adobe Creative Cloud. If you want to give it a go you can download a free trial here. While we're teaching using Lightroom, these skills apply on just about any editing tool and there are plenty of free options out there if you aren't ready to invest in Lightroom just yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;
