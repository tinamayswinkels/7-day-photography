Today we're going to teach you a little bit about shutter speed, aperture, and ISO.

The goal for this lesson is not for you to master manual photography in 15 minutes&nbsp;

— I’m going to help you understand some of the terminology that you hear thrown around and give you a sneak peak into a whole new world of creativity.

## How a camera works

Although cameras have a bunch of crazy cool tech inside them these days, they still follow the same principles as the very first cameras ever made.

Light enters the lens & into the camera body, how much light enters, is determined by the lens iris (**Aperture**), it then hits the shutter, which drops down when you depress the shutter button, exposing the light onto the sensor (or in the old days, film) & turning it into an image.

There are three elements used to manipulate light that we must balance in order to take a well exposed photo; **Aperture**, **Shutter Speed** & **ISO**. In order to find the correct balance, we must first understand each element & what they do, starting with **Aperture**.

**Aperture** controls the amount of light coming into the camera body which impacts 2 main things; the brightness of the image & the depth of field of the image
