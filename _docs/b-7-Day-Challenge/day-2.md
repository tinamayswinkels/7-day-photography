## Day 2 - How to shoot product & food photography

This is a BIG lesson. Today we're going to be walking you step-by-step through two photography techniques that Emilio has used on hundreds of paid client projects. It's the perfect way to get started, as they are skills that are simple to learn but as you practice and refine them you can create something really magical.First, we'll be creating this stunning shot, and you won't believe what we use to create this studio-style backdrop.&nbsp;

Secondly, we'll be practicing our flatlays creating a scene on a piece of fabric you can find around the house.&nbsp;

## Activity

Today's activity has two parts -- firstly try to use a large piece of paper, or a piece of fabric or sheet to create a smooth curved backdrop and shot some kind of food you can find around the house.&nbsp;

Secondly, we're going to find an interesting background (fabric, timber, one of the tiles on your floor etc) and shoot a flatlay. This could be products like skincare or shampoo, condiments from your kitchen, fruit or vegetables etc.&nbsp;

Can't wait to see what you come up with today, and remember that practice makes perfect -- be willing to experiment and make mistakes knowing that we all started at the beginning.&nbsp;<br><br>If you don't use facebook but still want to share your work, use the hashtag \#iocphotographychallenge to share your progress on Instagram.&nbsp;
