Hey everyone, hope you have been enjoying the challenge so far — it’s been incredibly rewarding watching you learn and improve over just 7 days of lessons and activities. With our next photography & social media bootcamp not until November I’ve missed teaching, and seeing how much effort you have put into the daily challenges has been epic\! You should all be really proud of yourselves.

This weekend Tina & I are going to sit down and film one more bonus tutorial for you guys, and I thought it would be fun to do an ‘ask-me-anything’… you comment on ^ this post in the [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/243183530226683/){: target="_blank"} with your questions and I will do my best to get through as many questions as I can\!
