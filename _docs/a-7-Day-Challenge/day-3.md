Hopefully by now you have a better understanding of your big picture goals, your brand personality and values and what you want to communicate to your target audience.&nbsp;

This lesson, we're going to take those broad strokes and build them into a content strategy.&nbsp;

In this tutorial I've used real examples of people who took the challenge earlier this year.&nbsp;

## Day 3 Activity&nbsp;

**STAGE 1 - Market Research & Inspiration**

1. Find three instagram accounts from your industry that you feel are very effective at communicating the benefits of the products or service&nbsp;
2. Find three brands that have the kind of brand personality you want to have, and look at how they communicate that personality&nbsp;
3. Find three instagram accounts that share some of your brand values (ie, inclusivity, fairness, sustainability, body positivity, equality, etc. ) &nbsp;

**Stage 2 - Content Strategy**

1. In 1 sentence summarise your brand personality&nbsp;
2. What are the top 5-10 things that you want your target audience to know, feel or believe about your business or brand
3. What are 3 - 5 things that your audience is interested in that you could share, that aren't directly self promotional?

**Stage 3 - Content Mapping&nbsp;**

This is the fun part, for every point listed above, try to brainstorm 3 - 5 pieces of content to target each point above. Get inspired from what you see in stage one, but don't be afraid to get creative\!&nbsp;

**Questions?**&nbsp;

## Example - Cafe in Canggu&nbsp;

**Want to communicate that brand personality is playful and fun.&nbsp;**

* playful photos of ice-cream melting
* dad jokes in some captions
* photo of the team throwing flour at each other&nbsp;

**Want your audience to know that you have plenty of gluten-free options&nbsp;**

* Showcase 3x gluten free menu items each &nbsp;month and specifically mention they are gluten free, and use gluten free hashtags&nbsp;
* have a instagram story highlight showcasing all the gluten free option
* add "GF options" to your bio&nbsp;

**You want your audience to trust that you have high quality, delicious food&nbsp;**

* share testimonials from yelp or trip advisor as a caption with a photo of the relevant dish or venue
* show photos of people actually enjoying the food in the restaurant, not just food photos&nbsp;
* show behind the scenes videos in your instagram stories of dished being made showing the level of care and detail taken&nbsp;
