Want to continue your social media journey? We've had lots of questions about where to go from here, and wanted to lay out all of your options.&nbsp;

## BONUS FREE RESOURCE

One of the exciting, but sometimes overwhelming things about the world of social media is that there are so many potential ways to build a career or launch a side hustle that it's hard to decide which direction to take. And as we spoke about in day 1's lesson, knowing your goals is critical to being able to build an effective strategy because each pathway requires a slightly different approach.&nbsp;<br><br>I've put together a one hour masterclass on how to earn money through social media, covering what to expect and the pros and cons of becoming:&nbsp;<br>\- an influencer<br>\- a blogger<br>\- a social media manager<br>\- a content creator&nbsp;<br><br>If you have loved this course so far we would love for you to help us spread the word and leave us a review or recommendation on [our facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/instituteofcode/reviews/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;(specifically mentioning that you did the online mini-course). **As a thank you, we'll send you this bonus lesson for free\!&nbsp;**<br><br>If you prefer to share your feedback privately, or for whatever reason don't like leaving reviews that's totally fine – [send us an email](mailto:hello@instituteofcode.com?subject=Feedback%20on%20Instagram%20Challenge) with your feedback and we'll share the video there.&nbsp;

## FAQs about our Social Media Bootcamp

Looking to take things to the next level? Our [hybrid bootcamp](http://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev){: target="_blank"} (6 weeks part time online + 10 day intensive in Bali + lifetime support) might be exactly what you need.&nbsp;

This program goes well beyond the basics and teaches you how to build a freelance career as a social media manager, influencer or content creator (or if you already have your own business, how to use these skills to grow that\!).&nbsp;<br><br>**1\. How does our hybrid online + in-person model work?&nbsp;**

The program starts with a self-paced online course learning from experts in the field through engaging video tutorials and practical activities. You can work through the content at your own pace (in as little as 4 days, or spread over a few hours a week for 6 weeks) and our mentors will be available via chat, email and skype to support you every step of the way.

Then you fly to Bali for an immersive 10 day bootcamp, building on your skills with practical experience and creating a resume-boosting portfolio of practical work. Oh, and it doesn't hurt that our program is all-inclusive in this beautiful villa in Bali complete with chef prepared meals and daily yoga to help you get into the flow state ideal for learning.

After the program, we've got your back with&nbsp;**lifetime technical & career support**.

**2\. What do you learn?&nbsp;**

First we show you how to find a niche, build your brand, come up with an effective marketing strategy and social media content plan. We look at all of the strategies at your disposal to grow, focusing on social media but also covering influencer marketing, pinterest, growing your email list, creating lead magnet sales funnels, driving website traffic with SEO and more.&nbsp;

Then we move from strategy to implementation - how to capture and edit epic photos in Lightroom, how to create engaging instagram stories, how to use the latest tools to schedule content on auto-pilot, and the apps that we use every day.&nbsp;

Finally we help you map out a 12-month strategy for what to do next, whether that's building up a freelance social media management or content creation agency, growing as a thought leader or influencer or building out the strategy for your own company.&nbsp;

We provide lifetime access to our library of tutorials, worksheets, templates (for instagram stories or social media graphics), real pitch templates (that we've used to land brand collaborations, free travel, and social media or content creation clients) to help you hit the ground running.&nbsp;<br><br>Then you are added into our private facebook community for alumni, where you have access to a network of people from all over the world and ongoing support from our team (via chat, skype call, etc.)

### Why learn in person instead of online?&nbsp;

The main difference though between an online course and in-person immersive is in the practical experience – it's one thing to understand the theory; It's another thing completely to start working with a brand and having the skills and the confidence to start charging clients\!&nbsp;<br><br>We focus in the bootcamp on taking the skills you have learnt in the video modules and applying them to real case studies. By the time you finish you'll have 3x solid portfolio examples (including one for your own business or brand) to refine your skills and show off to potential future clients.&nbsp;

*An example student project – strategy + marketing plan + photography + photo editing + social media grid mockup etc.&nbsp;*

We also cover how to take these skills and build them into a business, including how to find build an effective portfolio, find and pitch to clients, scope and price projects etc. We give our students everything they need to hit the ground running and start working on real client projects – and it's not uncommon for students to land their first paying client less than one month after the bootcamp.&nbsp;
