## Activity&nbsp;

For each of these points, brainstorm 1-3 tactics that you can use in your own feed...

1. Engagement -&nbsp; how popular the post is
2. Relevancy -&nbsp; the genres of people you have interacted with
3. Relationships -&nbsp; the accounts you regularly interact with
4. Timeliness -&nbsp; how recent the posts are
5. Profile Searches -&nbsp; the accounts you search often
6. Shares & Saves -&nbsp; the accounts you want to share with friends and save for later.
7. Time spent -&nbsp; how long you spend engaging with an accounts content
